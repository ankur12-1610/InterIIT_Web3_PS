The objective of this project is to create a blockchain-based chess game.

### Expected Outcome
- **Frontend**: A fully functional chess game is a must, it will be the stepping stone for blockchain integration.
- **Integrating with Smart Contracts**: Every move should be stored on a blockchain via a smart contract. We are not expecting you to implement multiplayer mode, CPU mode works.
- **Reward System**: To add an exciting element to the game, winners are rewarded with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). (Implementing this will add bonus points)

### Submission Guidelines
- **Submission deadline**: 22th September, 11:59 pm
- Your GitHub repository should contain a README.md of the detailed explaination of the project.
